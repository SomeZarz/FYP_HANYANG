# === OCV Calibration (Accuracy-Critical) ===
ocv_calibration:
  min_rest_hours: 1.0          # Minimum rest for OCV stabilization
  max_soc_start: 0.70           # Skip rest events with SOC > 60%
  ocv_table_path: null         # Set to "ocv_lfp.csv" for LFP batteries

# === Charging Detection (Field Data Essential) ===
charging:
  status_value: 3              # BMS status code for charging
  accept_partial_charges: true # CRITICAL: Must be true for real-world data
  full_charge_soc_threshold: 0.95  # Battery fully charged SOC threshold
  full_charge_voltage_v: 4.24  # Max cell voltage at full charge

# === Quality Thresholds (Sampling Frequency-Dependent) ===
quality_checks:
  min_samples_in_window: 25    # Min points in 3900-4050mV range
  max_gap_seconds: 90          # Max allowed gap between samples
  current_bounds_a: [0, 220]   # Charging current min/max (dataset-specific)
  current_sign_convention: physical  # 'physical', 'inverted', or 'forcepositive'
  voltage_smoothing: movingaverage  # 'interpolation', 'savgol', or 'movingaverage'

# === SOH Calculation (Paper-Specified) ===
soh_calculation:
  soh_bounds: [0.35, 1.25]       # Valid SOH range (allow 20% overhead)
  min_abs_delta_soc: 0.025      # Minimum SOC change for valid calculation
